# Platonic Face Normals
Visualize rotating platonic solid, showing all face normal vectors, based on one known face normal vector.

Figure showing octahedron face normals oriented with one face normal towards (1,1,1), with cube frame showing relation between the cube corners and the octahedron faces.

# Notes
I had need of a tool to visualize this in an easy language before implementing this later on Arduino. It is just a simple tool that does not have much other use.
